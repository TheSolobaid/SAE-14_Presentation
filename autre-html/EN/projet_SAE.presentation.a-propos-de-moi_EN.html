                        My name is Samuel Rolli, I am 18 years old and I was born on September 19, 2004. I am currently studying for a bachelor's degree in network and telecom at the Colmar institute of technology.
                        <br>
                        I grew up in Colmar until I was 10 years old, then moved to Montauban where I stayed until my Bac. 
                        <br>
                        Coming back to Alsace to study was quite natural because I kept family ties and an emotional attachment.

                        I've always been someone curious. I've always enjoyed building, tinkering and understanding how the world around me works. I started with sets of constructions of Lego or Kapla and then model-making, to finally acquire a 3D printer a few years later.

                    I’m also close to nature and that’s what makes me enjoy gardening, spending time outdoors or with my dogs. I also <a  href="https://thesolobaid.github.io/1erSiteEscalade/index.html">climb</a>,especially at the gym.I also took this year a subscription to the<a href="https://lesfreresmawem.fr/la-salle/">"salle d'escalade les frères Mawem".</a> This sport allows me to surpass myself, my dream is to be able to make outings in the mountains.

                    I also like to travel, watch series in original version as well as improve my skills in areas that I am passionate about, such as programming.
